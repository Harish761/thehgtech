## 🏆 TIER 1 — HIGHEST VOLUME GAPS (You DON'T have these yet)

These are high search volume keywords where you have NO existing guide and LOW-to-MEDIUM competition for a technically deep guide:

| # | Keyword Cluster | Est. Monthly Volume | Competition | Why It's Hot |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **"post quantum cryptography guide"** / "quantum safe encryption" / "PQC migration" | 15K-30K+ (exploding) | LOW for deep guides | NIST finalized PQ standards in 2024; Google/IBM pushing migration. 81% orgs say it's urgent. **Nobody has a good practitioner guide yet.** |
| 2 | **"how to implement zero trust step by step"** / "zero trust architecture guide 2026" | 40K-80K+ | MEDIUM | 81% of orgs implementing. You have `ztna-deployment` and `network-segmentation-zero-trust` but NO comprehensive "Zero Trust from scratch for SMBs" guide. |
| 3 | **"DMARC setup guide 2026"** / "SPF DKIM DMARC tutorial" / "email authentication how to" | 30K-50K+ | LOW-MEDIUM | Google/Yahoo/Microsoft now REJECTING non-DMARC emails. PCI DSS v4.0 requires it. You have `email-security-spf-dkim-dmarc` — but check if it's updated for 2026 enforcement. |
| 4 | **"cybersecurity career roadmap 2026"** / "how to start cybersecurity career" / "cybersecurity for beginners" | 80K-150K+ | HIGH but winnable | Massive volume. You have `soc-analyst-career-roadmap` but not a broader beginner-to-expert career guide. This is your highest-ceiling keyword. |
| 5 | **"AI deepfake detection guide"** / "how to detect deepfakes" / "deepfake defense for enterprise" | 20K-40K+ | LOW | You have `deepfake-defense` — verify it targets the right keywords and is updated for 2026 audio/video deepfake advances. |
| 6 | **"password manager guide 2026"** / "passkeys vs passwords" / "FIDO2 passwordless authentication" | 25K-50K+ | MEDIUM | Passkeys are going mainstream (Google, Apple, Microsoft). No existing guide on passwordless/passkeys. |
| 7 | **"how to respond to a data breach"** / "data breach response plan template" / "breach notification GDPR" | 20K-35K+ | LOW-MEDIUM | Evergreen + spikes with every major breach. You have `incident-response-automation` and `ransomware-response-playbook` but not a breach-specific playbook. |
| 8 | **"Microsoft Sentinel tutorial"** / "Azure Sentinel SIEM guide" / "KQL security queries" | 15K-25K+ | LOW | You have `splunk-spl-guide` and `siem-log-analysis` but nothing for Azure/Sentinel. Huge enterprise audience. |
| 9 | **"shadow AI detection"** / "how to find unauthorized AI tools" / "AI governance for security teams" | 10K-20K+ (rising fast) | VERY LOW | Brand new niche. You have `ai-governance-framework` — check if it covers shadow AI. Gartner's #1 risk for 2026. |
| 10 | **"supply chain security guide"** / "software supply chain attacks" / "SBOM guide" / "software bill of materials" | 15K-25K+ | LOW | SolarWinds/Log4j aftermath. SBOM now mandated by US Executive Order. No existing guide on SBOMs. |

## 🥈 TIER 2 — MEDIUM VOLUME, VERY LOW COMPETITION (Easy Wins)

| # | Keyword Cluster | Est. Monthly Volume | You Have It? | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | **"PCI DSS v4.0 compliance guide 2026"** | 8K-15K | ❌ No | Create — mandatory March 2025 deadline, still confusing most orgs |
| 12 | **"NIS2 directive compliance guide"** | 8K-12K | ❌ No | Create — EU regulation, affects 160,000+ companies |
| 13 | **"security awareness training program guide"** | 10K-20K | ❌ No | You have `phishing-simulation-security-awareness` but not a full training program guide |
| 14 | **"cloud pentesting guide"** / "AWS/Azure pentesting methodology" | 8K-15K | ❌ No | You have `penetration-testing-methodology` but not cloud-specific |
| 15 | **"mobile security hardening guide"** / "Android/iOS security for enterprise" | 10K-18K | ❌ No | Massive gap — mobile is 60% of enterprise endpoints now |
| 16 | **"dark web monitoring guide"** / "how to monitor dark web for company data" | 12K-20K | ❌ No | High executive interest, very few good technical guides |
| 17 | **"Kubernetes security audit checklist"** | 6K-10K | 🟡 Partial (`kubernetes-ai-security`) | Update or create dedicated K8s audit guide |
| 18 | **"business continuity plan cybersecurity template"** / "BCP disaster recovery" | 10K-18K | ❌ No | Evergreen enterprise content |
| 19 | **"GRC tool comparison guide"** / "governance risk compliance platform" | 5K-10K | ❌ No | Comparison content ranks well, you already do comparisons |
| 20 | **"MFA bypass attacks and defense"** / "phishing-resistant MFA guide" | 8K-15K | ❌ No | Hot topic: AiTM, push fatigue, SIM swap — none of your guides specifically cover MFA bypass |

## 📈 TIER 3 — EMERGING / PREDICTED BREAKOUT (Get There First)

| # | Keyword | Why It'll Explode | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | **"AI agent security checklist"** | You're already positioned here with articles + guides | NOW |
| 22 | **"agentic SOC guide"** / "AI SOC automation" | Gartner coined it — massive search spike expected Q2 2026 | 2-3 months |
| 23 | **"confidential computing guide"** | Intel TDX, AMD SEV, AWS Nitro — enterprise adoption accelerating | 3-6 months |
| 24 | **"cyber insurance requirements 2026"** | Insurers tightening requirements, companies desperately searching | NOW |

## ⚡ TOP 5 RECOMMENDATIONS (Build These First)

Based on **volume × competition × your existing strengths × 2026 relevance**:

### 1. 🥇 Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration Guide
> **Target Keywords:** "post quantum cryptography guide", "PQC migration", "quantum safe encryption how to", "NIST post quantum standards"
> **Why:** Exploding search volume, almost NO good practitioner-level guides. NIST standards finalized, Google pushing urgently. You'd own this niche.
> **Content Angle:** Hands-on migration guide with OpenSSL PQC config, hybrid certificates, algorithm comparison table, NIST timeline.

### 2. 🥈 Passkeys & Passwordless Authentication Guide  
> **Target Keywords:** "passkeys guide 2026", "FIDO2 passwordless authentication", "how to implement passkeys", "passkeys vs passwords"
> **Why:** Google/Apple/Microsoft all pushing passkeys. Consumer + enterprise interest. Zero existing guides on your site.
> **Content Angle:** Step-by-step passkey implementation for web apps, enterprise FIDO2 deployment, comparison with traditional MFA.

### 3. 🥉 Software Supply Chain Security & SBOM Guide
> **Target Keywords:** "software supply chain security", "SBOM guide", "software bill of materials how to", "supply chain attack prevention"
> **Why:** US Executive Order mandate, SolarWinds/XZ Utils aftermath. Massive enterprise demand. No existing guide.
> **Content Angle:** SBOM generation (Syft, SPDX, CycloneDX), dependency scanning, VEX documents, SLSA framework levels.

### 4. 🏅 PCI DSS v4.0 Compliance Guide
> **Target Keywords:** "PCI DSS v4.0 guide 2026", "PCI DSS 4.0 requirements checklist", "PCI v4 compliance"
> **Why:** Mandatory since March 2025 — thousands of orgs still scrambling. DMARC now required. Very specific, high-intent traffic.
> **Content Angle:** Requirement-by-requirement breakdown, implementation checklist, DMARC for PCI, ASV scanning updates.

### 5. 🏅 MFA Bypass Attacks & Phishing-Resistant Authentication
> **Target Keywords:** "MFA bypass attacks", "phishing resistant MFA", "AiTM attack defense", "push fatigue attack", "SIM swap prevention"
> **Why:** MFA bypass is THE attack technique of 2025-2026 (Midnight Blizzard, Scattered Spider all use it). Hot, specific, actionable.
> **Content Angle:** Attack demos (AiTM proxy, push fatigue, SS7), defense comparison table (TOTP vs push vs FIDO2 vs passkeys), detection with Entra ID/Okta logs.
