🚨 Your email security is useless against this attack.

Attackers are now sending phishing messages through Microsoft Teams.

Here's how it works:

1️⃣ Attacker creates fake organization (e.g., "Liceo de Artes y Oficios")
2️⃣ Invites you as "Guest" to their Teams
3️⃣ You get a legitimate Microsoft notification
4️⃣ Inside Teams: fake $99.99 billing notification
5️⃣ Click to "dispute" → credentials stolen

Why this is terrifying:

→ Bypasses email security (SEG, DMARC, SPF, DKIM)
→ Uses Microsoft's own infrastructure
→ Users trust Teams more than email  
→ Traditional defenses don't see it

What to do TODAY:

• Teams Admin Center → Restrict external access
• Enable Safe Links for Teams messages
• Train users: Teams can be phishing too
• Search audit logs for "Invite a Guest" events

The attack vector shifted. Your defenses should too.
