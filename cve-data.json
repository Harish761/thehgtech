This makes it possible for authenticated (subscriber-level) attackers to set the internal `prod_key_random_id` option, which can then be used by an unauthenticated attacker to bypass authentication checks and write arbitrary files to the server via the `handle_upload_single_big_file()` function, ultimately leading to remote code execution.",
