This is due to improper error handling in the RSA decryption process combined with a lack of path sanitization when writing uploaded files. When the plugin fails to decrypt a session key using openssl_private_decrypt(), it does not terminate execution and instead passes the boolean false value to the phpseclib library's AES cipher initialization. The library treats this false value as a string of null bytes, allowing an attacker to encrypt a malicious payload using a predictable null-byte key. Additionally, the plugin accepts filenames from the decrypted payload without sanitization, enabling directory traversal to escape the protected backup directory. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files to publicly accessible directories and achieve Remote Code Execution via the wpvivid_action=send_to_site parameter.",

This is due to improper error handling in the RSA decryption process combined with a lack of path sanitization when writing uploaded files. When the plugin fails to decrypt a session key using openssl_private_decrypt(), it does not terminate execution and instead passes the boolean false value to the phpseclib library's AES cipher initialization. The library treats this false value as a string of null bytes, allowing an attacker to encrypt a malicious payload using a predictable null-byte key. Additionally, the plugin accepts filenames from the decrypted payload without sanitization, enabling directory traversal to escape the protected backup directory. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files to publicly accessible directories and achieve Remote Code Execution via the wpvivid_action=send_to_site parameter.",
