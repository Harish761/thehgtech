From summarizing articles to predicting user intent, AI-powered browsers are redefining the browsing experience. Yet, behind this convenience lies a growing list of issues — from privacy concerns and resource drain to content manipulation and unclear data practices. As the race for “smart browsers” intensifies, the gap between innovation and responsible design is becoming increasingly visible.</p><h3>The Rise of AI-Powered Browsers</h3><p>Over the past year, browsers like <strong>Arc, Opera One, Microsoft Edge Copilot, and Brave Leo</strong> have rolled out native AI assistants that summarize pages, write emails, and even generate images directly from the browser sidebar. These tools aim to make web navigation faster and more intuitive, turning the browser into an intelligent workspace rather than a passive window to the web.</p><p>However, as these capabilities expand, so do the implications. AI browsers are not just reading web content — they’re analyzing user behavior, session data, and sometimes even personal information to train and personalize their models. This blurring of the line between user tool and data aggregator has triggered a heated debate about privacy and transparency.</p><h3>Performance Issues: When AI Eats RAM</h3><p>One of the first complaints users have about AI browsers is performance. Integrating on-device or cloud-based AI inference models is computationally expensive. Even lightweight tasks like summarization or chat-based assistance can spike CPU and GPU usage. For enterprise or multi-tab users, this translates to higher power consumption, memory bloat, and frequent slowdowns.</p><p>Microsoft’s Edge Copilot, for instance, has been criticized for running background telemetry processes even when the AI sidebar isn’t in use. Similarly, Opera’s Aria assistant uses persistent background requests to maintain contextual memory, which drains battery life on laptops. Users with mid-range hardware or limited connectivity often report lag, making “smart browsing” ironically slower than traditional methods.</p><h3>Privacy Concerns: Who Owns Your Data?</h3><p>Perhaps the most significant issue with AI browsers is data collection. To personalize results or maintain contextual awareness, these browsers often transmit user queries, browsing history, and interaction data to cloud-based models. This raises critical questions about ownership and consent.</p><ul><li><strong>Opaque data sharing:</strong> Many AI browsers send requests to third-party APIs like OpenAI or Anthropic without explicit user consent, often hidden under “improve experience” toggles.</li><li><strong>Cross-platform tracking:</strong> Integration with accounts (Google, Microsoft, Arc ID) allows cross-device data profiling that extends beyond the browser.</li><li><strong>Model retention:</strong> Some AI models cache user prompts for training, potentially exposing sensitive corporate or personal data.</li></ul><p>Privacy advocates warn that these practices create a <strong>“data loop”"

            "content": "\"<p>As organisations pursue or maintain certification to ISO/IEC 27001:2022, one of the key tasks is carrying out a gap analysis—comparing the current Information Security Management System (ISMS) to the standard requirements. Employing artificial intelligence (AI) in that process offers promising gains in speed and insight, provided it is used securely and thoughtfully.</p><h3>Why AI-assisted gap analysis matters</h3><p>The ISO 27001 framework requires you to: define context, perform risk assessments, select and implement controls, monitor performance, and improve continuously. Traditionally this work can be labor-intensive: reviewing documentation, mapping controls, interviewing stakeholders, and compiling findings. AI tools can accelerate these tasks by automating document review, highlighting inconsistencies, cross-referencing clauses and controls, and generating summary reports.</p><p>For example, a custom AI agent helped a software firm rapidly compare their existing controls to ISO 27001:2022, identify evidence gaps and automate register entries—saving over 65 hours of manual work. </p><h3>Technical mechanics of AI-driven gap analysis</h3><p>The typical workflow for AI-enhanced gap analysis includes:</p><ul><li>Ingesting data sources: policies, procedures, risk registers, system inventories, audit logs.</li><li>Mapping to standard: using the AI model (or prompts) to map each piece of evidence to ISO 27001 clauses and Annex A controls. </li><li>Identifying discrepancies: the AI flags where evidence is missing, control descriptions are insufficient, or processes are undocumented.</li><li>Prioritising findings: based on risk impact, business context and control maturity (human-in-the-loop judgement remains essential).</li><li>Generating remediation guidance: suggested actions, responsibilities, timelines for closing gaps.</li></ul><p>On the technical side, it’s important that the AI model is trained or configured on your own documentation formats and control frameworks to reduce false positives and context-mismatch. As one practitioner noted: “the mix of AI and human oversight paid off”. </p><h3>Real-world impact and risk of oversight</h3><p>Applying AI in this way brings tangible benefits: faster audits, better coverage, improved readiness for certification. Organisations report that they can identify hidden weaknesses in their ISMS sooner and allocate remediation resources more effectively.</p><p>However, mis-use or blind trust in AI can bring risk. In particular when organisations rely on an existing ISO 27001 certificate without assessing the full scope of systems (especially AI-driven or cloud systems). For example, one vendor’s certification covered infrastructure but not the AI model integrated into a service. That creates a blind spot.</p><h3>Key secure practices when using AI for gap analysis</h3><ul><li>Define the ISMS scope clearly: ensure all assets, including AI/ML systems, services and third-parties, are included.</li><li>Ensure data privacy and model security: the AI tool ingesting your documentation should operate in a secure environment, preserve confidentiality, and avoid training on sensitive data unless controlled.</li><li>Use human-in-the-loop review: AI may identify gaps, but judgement is needed to interpret business context, risk appetite, evidence quality and remediation feasibility.</li><li>Map findings back to risk and business impact: just flagging missing documentation is not enough—rank gaps by potential impact, compliance exposure and operational risk.</li><li>Ensure traceability and audit readiness: records of how AI produced findings, who reviewed them, and what was decided should be kept for audit visibility.</li></ul><h3>Expert insight on AI and ISO 27001 alignment</h3><p>Consulting firms working with ISO 27001 note that AI systems introduce new dimensions of risk: model integrity, training data provenance, service-provider oversight and algorithmic drift. This means that a gap analysis must go beyond checklist compliance and include control design and monitoring tailored to AI operations.</p><h3>Moving from analysis to action</h3><p>Once gaps are identified you must treat them as part of an improvement programme: assign ownership, define timelines, monitor progress, and verify effectiveness. The analysis is just step one of the “Plan → Do → Check → Act” cycle that ISO 27001 promotes.</p><p>AI tools can be retained for periodic re-assessments, helping maintain alignment as your environment changes and new systems (especially AI) are introduced.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Integrating AI into your ISO 27001 gap analysis process can deliver meaningful efficiency and insight—provided you treat it as a strategic tool, not a silver bullet. The real value comes when AI amplifies human expertise, secure processes and governance oversight.</p><p>In today’s environment, where data volumes grow, threats evolve and AI systems proliferate, organisations that adopt an AI-assisted approach to gap analysis will position their ISMS for higher maturity, stronger resilience and better audit readiness. The key: use AI securely, maintain clear scope and governance, and make human judgement central. That way you turn analysis into action, and readiness into assurance.</p>\"",

Attackers are using generative AI, reinforcement learning, and automated reconnaissance tools to breach systems faster than traditional security measures can respond.</p><h3>How AI Is Changing the Threat Landscape</h3><p>Modern cybercriminals now deploy AI models capable of adapting in real time, crafting unique malware variants, and launching context-aware phishing campaigns. According to the latest Global Threat Report, automated attack frameworks can now identify and exploit vulnerabilities in minutes, drastically reducing human intervention.</p><h3>Technical Insights</h3><p>Analysts note three major AI-driven threat techniques gaining traction:</p><ul><li><strong>Adaptive Malware:</strong> Self-learning code that alters its signature to evade detection engines.</li><li><strong>AI-Generated Phishing:</strong> Language models that mimic human tone and context for highly convincing messages.</li><li><strong>Autonomous Reconnaissance:</strong> Bots that scan infrastructure, prioritize targets, and launch exploits autonomously.</li></ul><p>Enterprises relying on static rule-based systems are increasingly vulnerable, as AI-powered threats exploit the speed and precision gap between machine learning and legacy defenses.</p><h3>Real-World Impact</h3><p>In several documented incidents, corporations have faced network intrusions where attackers used AI to pivot laterally, exfiltrate data, and delete traces before detection. Financial institutions and healthcare providers have been primary targets due to their high-value data and slow patch cycles.</p><h3>Expert Perspectives</h3><p>Cybersecurity experts emphasize that defensive AI must evolve equally fast. \\\"AI isn’t just a defensive tool anymore—it’s a weapon in the wrong hands,\\\" says Dr. Neel Sharma, Chief Security Scientist at ThreatVector Labs. “Companies must implement continuous learning systems and integrate AI into both prevention and response frameworks.”</p><h3>Defensive Measures</h3><p>Recommended enterprise strategies include:</p><ul><li>Deploying AI-powered anomaly detection systems to identify non-human behavior patterns.</li><li>Using zero-trust access controls and continuous identity verification.</li><li>Training employees to recognize AI-generated phishing or deepfake impersonations.</li><li>Conducting regular red-team exercises simulating AI-driven attacks.</li></ul><h3>The Road Ahead</h3><p>As AI integration deepens across all industries, cybersecurity must become adaptive, predictive, and data-driven. Experts agree that future SOCs (Security Operations Centers) will rely on hybrid human–AI teams, where algorithms handle scale and humans provide judgment.</p><p>The ultimate takeaway: AI is redefining cybersecurity’s balance of power. Organizations that fail to adapt risk facing attackers who learn, evolve, and strike faster than any human defender can react.</p>\"",
