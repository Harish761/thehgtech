# Creating the OG Image for Threat Intelligence Page

Since I can't generate the image due to API quota limits, here's how you can create it:

## Option 1: Use Canva (Easiest)
1. Go to https://canva.com
2. Create custom size: 1200 x 630 pixels
3. Use dark background template
4. Add text:
   - Title: "Live Threat Intelligence Dashboard"
   - Subtitle: "Real-time IOCs from 6 Security Vendors"
   - Brand: "TheHGTech"
5. Add cybersecurity icons/graphics
6. Download as JPG
7. Save as: `threat-intel-og.jpg`

## Option 2: Screenshot Your Dashboard
1. Open https://thehgtech.com/threat-intel.html
2. Take screenshot of the dashboard
3. Crop to 1200x630px
4. Add overlay text if needed
5. Save as: `threat-intel-og.jpg`

## Option 3: Use Figma/Photoshop
- Create 1200x630px canvas
- Dark gradient background (#0a0a0a to #1a1a2e)
- Cyan accent color (#00d9ff)
- Modern tech font
- Network/security graphics

## Where to Place It
