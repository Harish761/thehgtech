  - Breaking news (first to publish = first to rank)

  - Name-dropping (Microsoft, Google, China = search volume)

### 3. **Publishing Velocity**

## ✅ What You CAN Do: Differentiation Strategy

### **Don't Compete - DIFFERENTIATE**

THN = News aggregator (reports what happened)
TheHGTech = **Technical depth + Actionable tools**

## 🎯 The "Anti-THN" Strategy: 6 Competitive Advantages

### 1. **LIVE DATA (THN Doesn't Have This)**
You have:
- 52K+ live IOCs updated every 4 hours
- Real-time CVE tracking with CISA KEV
- Ransomware attack tracker
- Threat intel dashboard

**Action:** Make this your homepage focus. THN writes about threats; you SHOW live threats.

### 2. **INTERACTIVE TOOLS (THN = Static Content)**
Build tools security teams actually use:
- ✅ VS Code Extension Checker (capitalize on current news)
- ✅ IOC Lookup Tool (is this IP malicious?)
- ✅ CVE Priority Calculator (CVSS + EPSS + KEV)
- ✅ Embeddable widgets for SOC dashboards

**Viral potential:** Tools get shared in Slack/Discord, bookmarked by teams

### 3. **DEEP TECHNICAL GUIDES (THN = Surface News)**
THN: "Microsoft patches vulnerability" (200 words)
TheHGTech: "Complete NIST CSF 2.0 Implementation Guide" (5000+ words)

Your guides are research-grade. THN can't compete here.

### 4. **DOWNLOADABLE RESOURCES**
- IOC blocklists in STIX/CSV format
- Detection rules for Splunk/Sentinel
- Policy templates
- Checklists

THN has none of this. Security teams need files, not just articles.

### 5. **NICHE EXPERTISE: AI SECURITY**
You have dedicated AI security content:
- LLM jailbreaking guides
- MITRE ATLAS coverage
- AI agent security analysis

THN covers AI threats but not at your depth. Own this niche.

### 6. **FREE THREAT INTEL (THN Charges via Webinars)**
THN monetizes via sponsored "Expert Insights" webinars.
You offer free, no-signup-required threat data.
