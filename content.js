Industries reliant on detailed engineering specifications find RAG systems inadequate for extracting precise information. This shortcoming highlights the need for more advanced AI solutions capable of understanding complex data structures. Organizations must reassess their knowledge management strategies to ensure they can fully leverage their information assets. As AI technology evolves, addressing these limitations will be crucial for maintaining operational efficiency.",
