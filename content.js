            "content": "Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new phishing campaign that leverages PDF documents and Dropbox to deceive users into revealing sensitive information. This attack exploits the widespread trust in Dropbox and familiarity with PDFs to lure victims into clicking malicious links. The phishing emails typically contain a PDF attachment that claims to be an important document, prompting users to enter their credentials into a fake Dropbox login page. As these attacks continue to evolve with AI-driven tools, they remain effective due to their simplicity and the trust users place in widely used services. Security professionals are advised to educate users about verifying the authenticity of unexpected emails and to implement email filtering solutions to detect and block such threats.",
