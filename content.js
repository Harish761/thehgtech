            "content": "The newly released PageIndex framework is revolutionizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by effectively handling very long documents. This open-source solution boasts a 98.7% success rate in scenarios where traditional vector search methods falter. By addressing the limitations of the classic RAG workflow, PageIndex enhances the accuracy of document retrieval processes. This advancement is crucial for industries reliant on precise information extraction from extensive datasets. Developers and data scientists should consider integrating PageIndex into their RAG systems to improve performance and reliability.",
