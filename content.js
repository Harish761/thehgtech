            "content": "The ShinyHunters extortion gang has claimed responsibility for a series of voice phishing attacks targeting single sign-on (SSO) accounts at major platforms including Okta, Microsoft, and Google. These attacks enable unauthorized access to corporate software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, allowing threat actors to steal sensitive company data for extortion purposes. Companies relying on these SSO systems are at risk of data breaches, potentially leading to significant financial and reputational damage. This tactic underscores the increasing sophistication and boldness of cybercriminals in targeting key authentication systems. Organizations should enhance their security protocols, particularly around SSO implementations, to mitigate these risks.",
