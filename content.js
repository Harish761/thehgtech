            "content": "As cybercriminals continue to adapt, businesses must evolve their defenses to mitigate the risk of data breaches. In 2025, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) faced significant challenges as attackers increasingly targeted their networks to steal sensitive data for sale on the dark web. Experts recommend enhancing security measures by implementing zero-trust architectures, improving incident response times, and investing in employee cybersecurity training. These strategies are critical as attackers deploy more sophisticated tactics, exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated systems. With the growing frequency of attacks, businesses must prioritize cybersecurity to protect financial and personal data from malicious actors.",
