This development comes in response to privacy concerns, as the AI model operates on-device to detect and block potential scams. Users can now choose to disable this feature if they prefer not to have local AI processing. While this option offers more control, it may reduce the effectiveness of Chrome&#x27;s scam detection, especially for those who rely heavily on the browser&#x27;s security features. This move reflects growing user demand for customizable privacy settings in AI-powered applications.",
