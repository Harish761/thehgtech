            "content": "The Kimwolf Android botnet has grown to control over 2 million devices, leveraging residential proxy networks for monetization through distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, app installations, and selling proxy bandwidth. This botnet exploits Android devices, turning them into unwitting participants in large-scale cyber operations. The use of residential proxies enables the botnet to mask its activities, making detection and mitigation more challenging for cybersecurity teams. Such botnets pose a significant threat to both infrastructure and privacy, as they can be used to amplify attacks and distribute malicious payloads. Organizations should ensure their Android devices are updated and employ robust network monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns.",
