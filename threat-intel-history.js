The overwhelming majority of these IOCs (approximately 98% or 1,273,713) are attributed to phishing attacks, predominantly through malicious URLs, indicating that this vector remains the primary method of compromise. The critical threat count stands at 2,751, suggesting a tangible need for immediate remediation efforts, particularly against the backdrop of major campaigns such as Generic Phishing, which alone accounts for over 1.2 million IOCs. Organizations should prioritize monitoring and filtering of these identified malicious URLs and enhance their phishing detection capabilities to mitigate exposure to these evolving threats.",
