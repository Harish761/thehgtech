            <h1>Coupang's 33.7 Million User Breach: When Insider Threats Meet Inadequate Access Controls</h1>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Harish G</p>
            <p><strong>Published:</strong> December 07, 2025</p>
        </header>

        <p>On December 7, 2025, South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang issued a follow-up notice regarding one of the
            largest data breaches in the country's history—a compromise affecting <strong>33.7 million user
                accounts</strong>. What makes this incident particularly alarming isn't just the scale, but the
            mechanism: authorities suspect a <strong>former Chinese employee</strong> exploited unrevoked cryptographic
            signing keys to maintain unauthorized access for <strong>five months</strong> after leaving the company.</p>

        <p>As someone who has spent years analyzing insider threats and access control failures, I can tell you this
            breach represents a textbook case of what happens when organizations fail to implement proper offboarding
            procedures. The Coupang incident isn't just a data breach—it's a wake-up call about the critical importance
            of cryptographic key management and the persistent threat posed by malicious insiders.</p>

        <h2>The Breach Timeline: Five Months of Unauthorized Access</h2>
        <p>According to South Korean authorities and security researchers, the breach timeline reveals a disturbing
            pattern of prolonged unauthorized access:</p>

        <h3>June 24, 2025: Initial Unauthorized Access</h3>
        <p>The suspected former employee, who had already left South Korea, began accessing Coupang's systems from
            overseas. The individual allegedly exploited <strong>cryptographic signing keys that had not been
                revoked</strong> after their departure from the company.</p>

        <h3>June - November 2025: Five Months of Data Exfiltration</h3>
        <p>For approximately five months, the attacker maintained persistent access to Coupang's customer database,
            exfiltrating:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Names</strong> of 33.7 million customers</li>
            <li><strong>Email addresses</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Postal addresses and phone numbers</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Delivery address books</strong>, including entry codes for shared residential entrances</li>
            <li><strong>Order histories</strong> and certain order details</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>November 18, 2025: Breach Detection</h3>
        <p>Coupang detected the unauthorized access and began its investigation. The company has stated that <strong>no
                payment card numbers, bank account details, login credentials (passwords), or personal customs clearance
                codes were compromised</strong>.</p>

        <h3>December 7, 2025: Public Follow-Up Notice</h3>
        <p>Coupang issued an updated notice to affected customers, providing additional details about the scope and
            nature of the breach.</p>

        <h2>The Insider Threat: A Former Employee Under Investigation</h2>
        <p>South Korean authorities, including the National Police Agency, are investigating a <strong>former Chinese
                employee</strong> as the primary suspect. This individual reportedly:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Left South Korea</strong> before the breach began</li>
            <li><strong>Retained access</strong> to cryptographic signing keys after termination</li>
            <li><strong>Accessed systems remotely</strong> from overseas for five months</li>
            <li><strong>Exfiltrated massive amounts</strong> of customer data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The investigation is ongoing, with no evidence yet of secondary damage from the leaked data being sold or
            exploited. However, the geopolitical implications—a Chinese national allegedly stealing data from a major
            South Korean company—add a layer of complexity to what might otherwise be treated as a straightforward
            insider threat case.</p>

        <h2>The Root Cause: Unrevoked Cryptographic Keys</h2>
        <p>The technical root cause of this breach is both simple and inexcusable: <strong>Coupang failed to revoke
                cryptographic signing keys when the employee left the company</strong>.</p>

        <h3>What Are Cryptographic Signing Keys?</h3>
        <p>Cryptographic signing keys are digital credentials that authenticate and authorize access to systems and
            data. They function similarly to physical keys, but for digital infrastructure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Prove the identity of the user or system</li>
            <li><strong>Authorization</strong> - Grant access to specific resources</li>
            <li><strong>Non-repudiation</strong> - Provide proof that a specific user performed an action</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In enterprise environments, these keys are often used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>SSH access to servers and databases</li>
            <li>API authentication for internal services</li>
            <li>Code signing and deployment pipelines</li>
            <li>Encrypted communication channels</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Weren't the Keys Revoked?</h3>
        <p>While Coupang hasn't publicly disclosed the specific reasons, this type of failure typically stems from:</p>

        <h4>1. Inadequate Offboarding Procedures</h4>
        <p>Many organizations have comprehensive onboarding processes but treat offboarding as an afterthought.
            Cryptographic keys, especially those used for backend systems, are often overlooked during employee
            termination.</p>

        <h4>2. Decentralized Key Management</h4>
        <p>In large organizations, cryptographic keys may be distributed across multiple teams and systems. Without
            centralized visibility, it's easy to miss keys during offboarding.</p>

        <h4>3. Lack of Automated Revocation</h4>
        <p>Manual key revocation processes are error-prone. Organizations should implement automated systems that revoke
            all access credentials immediately upon employee termination.</p>

        <h4>4. Long-Lived Keys</h4>
        <p>Some organizations issue cryptographic keys with indefinite validity periods. Best practice is to use
            short-lived keys that expire automatically, reducing the window of opportunity for misuse.</p>

        <h2>The Scale: One of South Korea's Largest Breaches</h2>
        <p>With 33.7 million affected users, this breach ranks among the largest in South Korean history. To put this in
            perspective:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>South Korea's population</strong> is approximately 51 million</li>
            <li><strong>66% of the population</strong> had their Coupang data exposed</li>
            <li><strong>Coupang is the dominant e-commerce platform</strong> in South Korea, comparable to Amazon in the
                U.S.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The compromised data includes highly sensitive information:</p>

        <h3>Delivery Address Books and Entry Codes</h3>
        <p>In South Korea, many residential buildings use shared entrance systems with entry codes. The exposure of
            these codes creates physical security risks, potentially enabling unauthorized building access.</p>

        <h3>Order Histories</h3>
        <p>Order histories reveal purchasing patterns, lifestyle information, and potentially sensitive details about
            individuals' lives—medications, books, personal items, etc.</p>

        <h3>Complete Contact Information</h3>
        <p>Names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails provide everything needed for targeted phishing, social
            engineering, and identity theft attacks.</p>

        <h2>What Coupang Got Right (and Wrong)</h2>
        <p>Let's analyze Coupang's response to this breach:</p>

        <h3>What They Got Right:</h3>

        <h4>1. Transparent Communication</h4>
        <p>Coupang issued public notices and provided specific details about what data was and wasn't compromised. This
            transparency helps customers make informed decisions about their risk.</p>

        <h4>2. No Financial Data Compromised</h4>
        <p>The fact that payment card numbers, bank details, and passwords were not exposed suggests Coupang had proper
            data segmentation. The attacker's access was limited to customer profile and order data, not payment
            systems.</p>

        <h4>3. Cooperation with Authorities</h4>
        <p>Coupang is working with the National Police Agency to investigate the breach and identify the perpetrator.
        </p>

        <h3>What They Got Wrong:</h3>

        <h4>1. Five-Month Detection Window</h4>
        <p>The fact that unauthorized access persisted for five months indicates inadequate monitoring and anomaly
            detection. Organizations should detect unusual access patterns within days, not months.</p>

        <h4>2. Failure to Revoke Access Credentials</h4>
        <p>This is the fundamental failure that enabled the entire breach. Proper offboarding procedures should have
            revoked all cryptographic keys immediately upon the employee's departure.</p>

        <h4>3. Insufficient Access Controls</h4>
        <p>A single set of cryptographic keys should not provide access to 33.7 million customer records. Proper access
            controls should implement least-privilege principles and segment data access.</p>

        <h2>The Geopolitical Dimension</h2>
        <p>The fact that the suspect is a former Chinese employee adds geopolitical complexity to this incident. While
            there's no evidence yet linking this to state-sponsored activity, the optics are concerning:</p>

        <h3>South Korea-China Tensions</h3>
        <p>South Korea and China have complex economic and political relationships. A Chinese national allegedly
            stealing data from a major South Korean company will inevitably fuel concerns about economic espionage and
            data sovereignty.</p>

        <h3>Cross-Border Data Protection</h3>
        <p>The suspect allegedly accessed Coupang's systems from overseas, highlighting the challenges of enforcing data
            protection laws across borders. Even if South Korean authorities identify and charge the individual,
            extradition may be impossible.</p>

        <h3>Supply Chain and Workforce Security</h3>
        <p>This incident will likely prompt South Korean companies to reassess their hiring practices, background
            checks, and access controls for foreign nationals—a sensitive topic that must be balanced against legitimate
            business needs and anti-discrimination principles.</p>

        <h2>Lessons for Organizations: Preventing Insider Threats</h2>
        <p>The Coupang breach offers critical lessons for any organization managing sensitive customer data:</p>

        <h3>1. Implement Automated Offboarding</h3>
        <p>Offboarding should be as rigorous as onboarding. Implement automated systems that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Revoke all access credentials immediately upon termination</li>
            <li>Disable VPN access, SSH keys, API tokens, and application passwords</li>
            <li>Remove user accounts from all systems and services</li>
            <li>Audit access logs to ensure no lingering permissions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Centralize Cryptographic Key Management</h3>
        <p>Use centralized key management systems that provide:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visibility</strong> - Complete inventory of all cryptographic keys</li>
            <li><strong>Lifecycle management</strong> - Automated rotation and expiration</li>
            <li><strong>Revocation capabilities</strong> - Instant revocation across all systems</li>
            <li><strong>Audit trails</strong> - Comprehensive logging of key usage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Use Short-Lived Credentials</h3>
        <p>Instead of issuing long-lived cryptographic keys, implement short-lived credentials that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expire automatically after hours or days</li>
            <li>Require regular re-authentication</li>
            <li>Minimize the window of opportunity for misuse</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Implement Least-Privilege Access</h3>
        <p>No single employee should have access to 33.7 million customer records. Implement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Role-based access control (RBAC)</strong> - Grant access based on job function</li>
            <li><strong>Data segmentation</strong> - Divide databases into smaller, access-controlled segments</li>
            <li><strong>Just-in-time access</strong> - Grant elevated privileges only when needed, for limited durations
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Deploy Anomaly Detection</h3>
        <p>Implement systems that detect unusual access patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access from unexpected geographic locations</li>
            <li>Unusual data access volumes</li>
            <li>Access outside normal working hours</li>
            <li>Attempts to access data unrelated to job function</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. Conduct Regular Access Audits</h3>
        <p>Don't wait for a breach to discover orphaned credentials. Regularly audit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All active user accounts and their permissions</li>
            <li>Cryptographic keys and their usage</li>
            <li>Service accounts and API tokens</li>
            <li>Third-party integrations and their access levels</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Coupang Customers Should Do</h2>
        <p>If you're a Coupang customer, here's what you should do to protect yourself:</p>

        <h3>1. Change Residential Entry Codes</h3>
        <p>If you live in a building with a shared entrance code that was stored in your Coupang delivery address book,
            <strong>change the code immediately</strong>. Coordinate with building management or neighbors.</p>

        <h3>2. Monitor for Phishing Attempts</h3>
        <p>With your name, email, phone number, and address exposed, expect targeted phishing attempts. Be extremely
            cautious about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emails claiming to be from Coupang or delivery services</li>
            <li>Phone calls requesting personal information or payment details</li>
            <li>SMS messages with suspicious links</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Review Order Histories for Sensitive Purchases</h3>
        <p>If your order history includes sensitive purchases (medications, books on sensitive topics, etc.), be aware
            that this information is now potentially public. Consider what risks this might pose.</p>

        <h3>4. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
        <p>While passwords weren't compromised in this breach, enable MFA on your Coupang account and any other accounts
            using the same email address.</p>

        <h3>5. Monitor Financial Accounts</h3>
        <p>Although payment data wasn't exposed, monitor your bank and credit card statements for unusual activity. The
            exposed information could be used for identity theft.</p>

        <h2>The Broader Implications for E-Commerce Security</h2>
        <p>The Coupang breach has implications beyond South Korea:</p>

        <h3>E-Commerce Platforms Are High-Value Targets</h3>
        <p>E-commerce platforms hold comprehensive profiles of millions of users—purchase histories, addresses, payment
            methods, and behavioral data. This makes them attractive targets for both cybercriminals and nation-state
            actors.</p>

        <h3>Insider Threats Are Underestimated</h3>
        <p>Organizations invest heavily in perimeter security but often neglect insider threat programs. The Coupang
            breach demonstrates that insiders—especially those with technical knowledge and access to cryptographic
            keys—pose significant risks.</p>

        <h3>Offboarding Is a Critical Security Control</h3>
        <p>The industry has treated offboarding as an HR process, not a security control. This breach proves that
            inadequate offboarding can lead to catastrophic data breaches.</p>

        <h3>Cross-Border Data Access Complicates Enforcement</h3>
        <p>As companies operate globally and employ international workforces, the risk of cross-border data theft
            increases. Legal and technical controls must account for this reality.</p>

        <h2>Regulatory and Legal Consequences</h2>
        <p>Coupang will likely face significant regulatory and legal consequences:</p>

        <h3>South Korean Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)</h3>
        <p>Under PIPA, organizations that experience data breaches must notify affected individuals and the Personal
            Information Protection Commission. Failures in data protection can result in fines up to 3% of annual
            revenue.</p>

        <h3>Class Action Lawsuits</h3>
        <p>With 33.7 million affected users, Coupang will almost certainly face class action lawsuits seeking
            compensation for the breach.</p>

        <h3>Reputational Damage</h3>
        <p>The long-term reputational impact may be more significant than regulatory fines. Customer trust, once lost,
            is difficult to rebuild.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: A Preventable Catastrophe</h2>
        <p>The Coupang breach is a preventable catastrophe that resulted from a fundamental failure in access control
            and offboarding procedures. A former employee should never have retained access to cryptographic keys after
            leaving the company. That access should never have granted the ability to exfiltrate 33.7 million customer
            records. And unauthorized access should never have persisted for five months undetected.</p>

        <p>This incident serves as a stark reminder that <strong>insider threats are real, persistent, and potentially
                catastrophic</strong>. Organizations must treat offboarding with the same rigor as onboarding, implement
            centralized cryptographic key management, deploy anomaly detection systems, and enforce least-privilege
            access controls.</p>

        <p>For Coupang's 33.7 million affected customers, the immediate risks include phishing attacks, physical
            security concerns (entry codes), and potential identity theft. For the broader e-commerce industry, this
            breach is a wake-up call about the critical importance of insider threat programs and proper access control
            management.</p>

        <p><strong>The keys to your kingdom should be revoked the moment someone walks out the door. Coupang learned
                this lesson the hard way. Don't let your organization be next.</strong></p>
