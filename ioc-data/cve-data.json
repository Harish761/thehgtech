Though authentication and authorization can be configured using IPsec for 92xx-K5 devices and mTLS for 92xx-K7 devices, it is not enabled by default and must therefore be activated with additional steps.\n\nThis insecure default allows an attacker with network level access to completely control the whole environment. An attacker is for example easily able to conduct the following tasks without prior authentication:\n- Re-configure Access Managers (e.g. remove alarming system requirements)\n- Freely re-configure the inputs and outputs\n- Open all connected doors permanently\n- Open all doors for a defined time interval\n- Change the admin password\n- and many more\n\nNetwork level access can be gained due to an insufficient network segmentation as well as missing LAN firewalls.

      "fullDescription": "dcap-qvl implements the quote verification logic for DCAP (Data Center Attestation Primitives). A vulnerability present in versions prior to 0.3.9 involves a critical gap in the cryptographic verification process within the dcap-qvl. The library fetches QE Identity collateral (including qe_identity, qe_identity_signature, and qe_identity_issuer_chain) from the PCCS. However, it skips to verify the QE Identity signature against its certificate chain and does not enforce policy constraints on the QE Report. An attacker can forge the QE Identity data to whitelist a malicious or non-Intel Quoting Enclave. This allows the attacker to forge the QE and sign untrusted quotes that the verifier will accept as valid. Effectively, this bypasses the entire remote attestation security model, as the verifier can no longer trust the entity responsible for signing the quotes. All deployments utilizing the dcap-qvl library for SGX or TDX quote verification are affected. The vulnerability has been patched in dcap-qvl version 0.3.9. The fix implements the missing cryptographic verification for the QE Identity signature and enforces the required checks for MRSIGNER, ISVPRODID, and ISVSVN against the QE Report. Users of the `@phala/dcap-qvl-node` and `@phala/dcap-qvl-web` packages should switch to the pure JavaScript implementation, `@phala/dcap-qvl`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users must upgrade to the patched version to ensure that QE Identity collateral is properly verified.",

Tokens included user-identifiable components and were not cryptographically secure, making them susceptible to guessing or enumeration. The vulnerability could have allowed unauthorized access to user accounts or API actions protected by these tokens. A fix is available in version 2.3.0 of NervesHub. This version introduces strong, cryptographically-random tokens using `:crypto.strong_rand_bytes/1`, hashing of tokens before database storage to prevent misuse even if the database is compromised, and context-aware token storage to distinguish between session and API tokens. There are no practical workarounds for this issue other than upgrading. In sensitive environments, as a temporary mitigation,\nfirewalling access to the NervesHub server can help limit exposure until an upgrade is possible.",

An attacker is for example easily able to conduct the following tasks without prior authentication:\n- Re-configure Access Managers (e.g. remove alarming system requirements)\n- Freely re-configure the inputs and outputs\n- Open all connected doors permanently\n- Open all doors for a defined time interval\n- Change the admin password\n- and many more\n\nNetwork level access can be gained due to an insufficient network segmentation as well as missing LAN firewalls.

      "fullDescription": "dcap-qvl implements the quote verification logic for DCAP (Data Center Attestation Primitives). A vulnerability present in versions prior to 0.3.9 involves a critical gap in the cryptographic verification process within the dcap-qvl. The library fetches QE Identity collateral (including qe_identity, qe_identity_signature, and qe_identity_issuer_chain) from the PCCS. However, it skips to verify the QE Identity signature against its certificate chain and does not enforce policy constraints on the QE Report. An attacker can forge the QE Identity data to whitelist a malicious or non-Intel Quoting Enclave. This allows the attacker to forge the QE and sign untrusted quotes that the verifier will accept as valid. Effectively, this bypasses the entire remote attestation security model, as the verifier can no longer trust the entity responsible for signing the quotes. All deployments utilizing the dcap-qvl library for SGX or TDX quote verification are affected. The vulnerability has been patched in dcap-qvl version 0.3.9. The fix implements the missing cryptographic verification for the QE Identity signature and enforces the required checks for MRSIGNER, ISVPRODID, and ISVSVN against the QE Report. Users of the `@phala/dcap-qvl-node` and `@phala/dcap-qvl-web` packages should switch to the pure JavaScript implementation, `@phala/dcap-qvl`. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. Users must upgrade to the patched version to ensure that QE Identity collateral is properly verified.",

Tokens included user-identifiable components and were not cryptographically secure, making them susceptible to guessing or enumeration. The vulnerability could have allowed unauthorized access to user accounts or API actions protected by these tokens. A fix is available in version 2.3.0 of NervesHub. This version introduces strong, cryptographically-random tokens using `:crypto.strong_rand_bytes/1`, hashing of tokens before database storage to prevent misuse even if the database is compromised, and context-aware token storage to distinguish between session and API tokens. There are no practical workarounds for this issue other than upgrading. In sensitive environments, as a temporary mitigation,\nfirewalling access to the NervesHub server can help limit exposure until an upgrade is possible.",
