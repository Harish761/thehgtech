STOP. 🛑

Your n8n workflows are leaking secrets right now.

I just analyzed "Ni8mare" — two CVSS 10.0 vulnerabilities affecting 100,000+ n8n automation servers.

Here's what attackers can do:

→ Read ANY file on your server (no auth required)
→ Steal API keys, OAuth tokens, database credentials
→ Execute arbitrary code on your infrastructure
→ Pivot to connected cloud services

The scary part?

n8n is everywhere:
• DevOps teams automating deployments
• Marketing teams syncing data
• Security teams (ironically) automating alerts
• Startups connecting everything to everything

Both CVEs scored CVSS 10.0/10.0
Both are trivial to exploit.
One doesn't even need authentication.

Swipe through for:
📌 How the attack chain works
📌 Quick self-assessment checklist
📌 5-step remediation guide
📌 Why this is Log4Shell-level serious

If you're running n8n < v1.76.0, patch IMMEDIATELY.
