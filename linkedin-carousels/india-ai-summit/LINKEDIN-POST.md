🔥 The Wrapper Epidemic: Behind the Curtain of the India AI Summit 2026

I just finished reviewing the massive fallout from the Bharat Mandapam here in New Delhi.

The promise was simple: "Sovereign AI."
The reality? A massive injection of venture capital into glorified API tollbooths.

We witnessed "indigenous" LLMs openly admitting they were created by OpenAI.

We saw a highly praised "Make in India" quadruped robotic dog quickly identified as an off-the-shelf import from a Chinese robotics firm.

How did we get here?

Because the allure of quick Unicorn valuations has incentivized a fast-food approach to machine learning. A thin UI layer over foreign infrastructure is not technological independence.

Here is the hard truth confronting the Global South:


❌ Rebranding is not Innovation.
Paying API taxes to Menlo Park while slapping a new logo on the UI does not build a sovereign ecosystem.

❌ Silos Destroy Progress.
Sam Altman and Dario Amodei couldn't coordinate a simple hand-raise on the main stage. Expecting massive corporations to cooperatively guide humanity's ethical future is a pipe dream.

✅ The Future is the Edge.
The real innovators at the summit weren't the ones burning $50M in compute. It was the teams building precise, Small Language Models (SLMs) that can give agricultural advice to rural farmers over a 3G connection on a $150 smartphone.


The age of the wrapper must end.
The era of the foundational builder must begin.

I just published a massive 20-minute investigative deep dive into the chaos, the fraud, and the genuine brilliance buried beneath the vendor booths at the India AI Summit.
