91,000 attacks.

Not on your servers.
Not on your endpoints.
On your AI agents.

In just 3 months (Oct 2025 - Jan 2026), threat actors launched 91,000+ attack sessions targeting AI infrastructure.

If you're deploying AI agents in your organization, this is the thread you need to read ⬇️

Here's what we're seeing:

→ 73% of LLM deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection
→ 45% of AI-generated code contains security flaws
→ GPT-4 can autonomously exploit vulnerabilities with 87% success rate

The attack surface has fundamentally shifted.

We spent decades securing HUMAN operators.
Now attackers are targeting MACHINE operators.

Why AI agents are the perfect target:

1️⃣ They have elevated privileges
   → Access to databases, APIs, source code
   → Often more access than any human user

2️⃣ They're harder to monitor
   → Actions look "legitimate"
   → No suspicious login times or locations

3️⃣ They can be manipulated
   → Prompt injection bypasses intent
   → Context poisoning corrupts behavior

4️⃣ They operate at machine speed
   → Faster data exfiltration
   → Faster lateral movement

Real attack scenarios we're tracking:

🔴 Coding assistants adding backdoors via comment injection
🔴 Email AI forwarding executive emails to external addresses
🔴 Customer service bots leaking customer data through manipulation
🔴 Workflow automation stealing credentials from connected systems

What security teams need to do TODAY:

1️⃣ INVENTORY your AI agents
   (You can't secure what you don't know exists)

2️⃣ AUDIT their permissions
   (Least privilege applies to AI too)

3️⃣ MONITOR their behavior
   (Log everything. Detect anomalies.)

4️⃣ TEST for prompt injection
   (Your pentesters should target AI)

5️⃣ TREAT AI as a privileged interface
   (Same controls as admin accounts)

The skills gap is pushing companies to deploy AI faster.

Which is exactly why attackers are pivoting to AI as the new attack vector.

Don't let your automation become your backdoor.

## 📊 CAROUSEL SLIDE CONTENT

### Slide 1: Hook
```
AI AGENTS ARE THE 
NEW ATTACK VECTOR

91,000+ Attack Sessions
in Just 3 Months

Your automation is their entry point.

```

### Slide 2: The Stats
```
THE NUMBERS ARE ALARMING

📊 91,000+ attack sessions
   (Oct 2025 - Jan 2026)

🔴 73% of LLM deployments
   vulnerable to prompt injection

⚠️ 45% of AI-generated code
   contains security flaws

🎯 87% success rate for
   autonomous exploitation

This is happening NOW.
```

### Slide 3: Why AI Agents Are Targets
```
WHY ATTACKERS LOVE AI AGENTS

1️⃣ ELEVATED PRIVILEGES
   Access to databases, APIs, code
   More access than most humans

2️⃣ HARDER TO MONITOR  
   Actions look "legitimate"
   No suspicious patterns

3️⃣ EASILY MANIPULATED
   Prompt injection bypasses intent
   Context poisoning works

4️⃣ MACHINE SPEED
   Faster data exfiltration
   Faster lateral movement
```

### Slide 4: Real Attack Scenarios
```
REAL ATTACKS WE'RE TRACKING

🔴 CODING ASSISTANT
   Adding backdoors via comment injection

🔴 EMAIL AI
   Forwarding C-suite emails externally

🔴 CUSTOMER SERVICE BOT
   Leaking customer data through manipulation

🔴 WORKFLOW AUTOMATION
   Stealing credentials from connected systems

These aren't theoretical.
They're happening.
```

### Slide 5: Attack Chain
```
THE AI ATTACK CHAIN

User Input
    ↓
Malicious Prompt
    ↓
AI Agent Processes
    ↓
Malicious Action Executed
    ↓
Data Exfiltration

No malware needed.
Just words.
```

### Slide 6: Shadow AI
```
THE SHADOW AI PROBLEM

❓ How many AI agents are in your org?

❓ Who deployed them?

❓ What can they access?

❓ Who's monitoring them?

If you can't answer these...

You have a Shadow AI problem.
```

### Slide 7: Action Plan
```
YOUR AI SECURITY CHECKLIST

1️⃣ INVENTORY all AI agents
   → Map what exists

2️⃣ AUDIT permissions
   → Least privilege

3️⃣ MONITOR behavior
   → Log everything

4️⃣ TEST for injection
   → Red team your AI

5️⃣ TREAT as privileged
   → Same controls as admins

Don't wait for the breach.

## 📅 POSTING STRATEGY

### Best Time
- **Monday/Tuesday 8-10 AM** (start of work week)
- **Wednesday 12-2 PM** (lunchtime engagement)
- AI content performs well mid-week when professionals are thinking strategy

### Text vs. Carousel?
For this topic: **BOTH WORK**
- **Text-only**: Works great for this topic - strong narrative flow
- **Carousel**: Higher dwell time, more saves
- **Recommendation**: Start with TEXT POST, gauge engagement, then post carousel version later in week

### Engagement Strategy
1. Post main content
2. IMMEDIATELY add first comment with link
3. Add second comment with questions after 10 minutes
4. Reply to every comment within first hour
5. Ask follow-up questions to drive discussion
6. Reshare key stats as standalone posts later
