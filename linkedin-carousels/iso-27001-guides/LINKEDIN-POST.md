ISO 27001:2022 certification on your 2026 roadmap?

Here's the uncomfortable truth:
→ 67% of organizations fail their first audit
→ The #1 reason? They skip the gap analysis
→ The #2 reason? No structured roadmap

We just released two comprehensive guides to fix both problems:

📋 Gap Analysis Framework
• Covers all 93 Annex A controls
• Ready-to-use scoring templates
• Priority mapping based on risk

🗺️ Certification Roadmap
• 6-phase implementation journey
• Stage 1 & Stage 2 audit prep
• Real auditor tips and war stories

Whether you're:
✓ Starting fresh in Q1 2026
✓ Transitioning from ISO 27001:2013
✓ Helping clients get certified

These guides will save you weeks of work.

Both completely free. No email required.

## 📊 POSTING TIPS

### Best Time to Post
- **Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM** local time (peak B2B engagement)
- **Avoid weekends** for professional content

### Engagement Boost
1. Reply to every comment within the first hour
2. Like and respond to shares
3. Tag relevant connections who might benefit (in a separate comment, not the main post)

### Links in Comments Strategy
✅ **Why we put links in the first comment:**
- LinkedIn's algorithm deprioritizes posts with external links in the main body
- Posts without links get 2-3x more reach
- The CTA slide tells people to check comments
- First comment from the author stays at the top
