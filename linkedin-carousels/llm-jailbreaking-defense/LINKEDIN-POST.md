```
I spent 40+ hours creating a 2-part LLM Jailbreaking Defense series.

Here's what attackers don't want you to know about bypassing AI safety:

𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝟏: 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐬
→ DAN prompts & "Do Anything Now" exploits
→ Roleplay attacks that trick AI personas
→ Token smuggling via Unicode/Base64
→ Multi-turn escalation strategies
→ Defense patterns that actually work

𝐏𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝟐: 𝐀𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 (𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐞 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐬)
→ Token-level attacks (GCG/Adversarial suffixes)
→ Automated jailbreak fuzzing
→ ML-based detection pipelines
→ Enterprise defense-in-depth architecture
→ Real case studies from production systems

Why this matters in 2026:
• 94% of executives say AI is the top cybersecurity driver (WEF)
• System Prompt Leakage is now OWASP LLM Top 10 #7
• Agentic AI attacks are scaling faster than defenses

Both guides are FREE.

Drop a "🔐" in comments and I'll send the links.
