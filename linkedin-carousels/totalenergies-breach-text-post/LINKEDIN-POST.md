🚨 BREAKING: 183 million customer records allegedly stolen from TotalEnergies.

This isn't just another data breach.

This is bank account numbers, emails, addresses, and phone numbers of millions of French customers — potentially 1 in 3 French residents.

Here's what makes this terrifying:

→ Bank account data = immediate fraud risk
→ Attackers already posted samples as proof
→ IBAN formats verified as authentic French
→ Energy sector is officially under siege

Let me be blunt:

If you're a TotalEnergies customer:
• Check your bank accounts RIGHT NOW
• Enable fraud alerts TODAY
• Expect sophisticated phishing emails

If you're in security:
• Energy sector breaches are up 10x
• Third-party risk is still being ignored
• GDPR regulators are watching (€200B+ company)

The pattern is clear:
- Taiwan: 2.63M daily cyberattacks on energy
- Romania: Water authority ransomware
- TotalEnergies: 183M records

Critical infrastructure is the new target.

Are you prepared?
