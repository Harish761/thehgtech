# LinkedIn Post: MEDUSA Security Scanner - AI-First SAST Guide

## 📅 Created: January 27, 2026

## 📝 MAIN POST (Copy this)

```
Your .cursorrules file is an attack surface.

And your SAST tool can't see it.

Meet MEDUSA — the first security scanner built for the AI era.

Here's what makes it different ⬇️

Traditional SAST tools scan code for vulnerabilities.
MEDUSA scans code + your AI configuration files.

What it checks:
→ .cursorrules (Cursor AI)
→ CLAUDE.md (Claude Code)
→ mcp.json (MCP servers)
→ copilot-instructions.md
→ rag.json / knowledge.json
→ Agent memory configs

Why this matters NOW:

Every developer is using AI coding assistants.
Every repo has AI config files.
Every AI config is a potential prompt injection target.

MEDUSA by the numbers:

🔍 74 specialized scanners
🤖 180+ AI agent security rules
🎯 40-60% false positive reduction
⚡ 10-40x faster than sequential

What attacks it detects:

💉 Prompt injection patterns
🔧 Tool poisoning (CVE-2025-6514)
📚 RAG knowledge base attacks
🧠 Memory poisoning
🔀 Workflow hijacking
🎭 Agent impersonation

Full OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 coverage.

Setup takes 5 minutes:

pip install medusa-security
medusa init
medusa install --all
medusa scan .

Done.

Free. Open source. Works everywhere.

If you're building with AI coding assistants, this is essential.

Full implementation guide with CI/CD examples linked below.

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE: SINGLE IMAGE POST

If you want to post immediately, use the **guide featured image**:
`/images/guides/medusa-security-scanner.png`

This works great as a standalone image with the post text above.

---

## 📅 POSTING STRATEGY

### Best Time
- **Tuesday/Wednesday 8-10 AM** (DevSecOps content performs well mid-week)
- **Thursday 12-2 PM** (Engineering leadership engagement)
- This is tool/productivity content - weekday morning optimal

### Text vs. Carousel?
For this topic: **EITHER WORKS**
- **Carousel**: Better for step-by-step explanation
- **Single Image + Text**: Works great for tool announcements
- The featured image is strong enough for single-image post

### Engagement Strategy
1. Post with caption
2. IMMEDIATELY add first comment with guide link
3. Add second comment with questions after 10-15 minutes
4. Reply to every comment in first hour
5. Tag Cursor, Claude, GitHub Copilot in replies if relevant

---

## 🎯 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

Based on DevSecOps + AI tool crossover:
- **Impressions**: 50,000-100,000 (DevSecOps + AI dev audience)
- **Saves**: HIGH (practical tool guide)
- **Comments**: Medium-High (tool recommendations drive discussion)
- **Click-through**: 6-10% to full guide
- **Reshares**: Medium (people tag security teams)
- **Best angle**: "Your AI config is an attack surface" + practical solution
