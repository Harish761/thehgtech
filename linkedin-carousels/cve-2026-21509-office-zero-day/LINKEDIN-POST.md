## 📝 MAIN POST (Copy this)

```
Microsoft Office has a ZERO-DAY

And it's being actively exploited right now.

CVE-2026-21509 bypasses ALL your OLE security controls.

Here's what you need to know ⬇️

The attack chain is simple:
→ Phishing email arrives
→ User opens malicious .docx
→ OLE/COM security check → BYPASSED
→ Code execution

CVSS Score: 7.8 (HIGH)

What makes this particularly dangerous:

Microsoft's security decision logic trusts data it shouldn't.
The OLE mitigations you thought protected you? Bypassed.
No public PoC yet, but that's temporary.

Who's affected:
• Microsoft 365 Apps
• Office LTSC 2024
• Office LTSC 2021
• Office 2019
• Office 2016

Literally every Office version.

CISA added this to the KEV catalog immediately.
Federal agencies must patch by February 16.

How to protect yourself:

✅ Microsoft 365/Office 2021+: Restart ALL Office apps (auto-protected)
✅ Office 2016: Install KB5002713 manually
✅ Enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules
✅ Train users on phishing awareness

The good news: Preview Pane is NOT an attack vector.
You must actually open the file.

Don't wait for the PoC to drop.
Patch now.

## 📅 POSTING STRATEGY

### Best Time
- **Immediate**: This is breaking security news - post ASAP
- If timing: **Tuesday-Thursday 8-10 AM** for DevSecOps/IT audience
- **Avoid**: Weekend posting for security content

### Text vs. Carousel?
**CAROUSEL RECOMMENDED** for this post because:
- Complex technical content benefits from visual breakdown
- Attack chain visualization increases comprehension
- Urgency/timeline slides create engagement
- Multiple touchpoints increase dwell time

### Engagement Strategy
1. Post carousel with caption
2. IMMEDIATELY add first comment with article link
3. Add second comment with questions after 15 minutes
4. Reply to every comment in first 2 hours
5. Tag Microsoft, CISA if relevant discussions arise
6. Cross-post to relevant LinkedIn groups (ISACA, (ISC)², etc.)
