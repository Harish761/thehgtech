## 📝 MAIN POST (Copy this)

```
Everyone's talking about Clawdbot.

"It's JARVIS for real!"
"30K GitHub stars in weeks!"
"Self-hosted AI that controls everything!"

But nobody's talking about THIS ⬇️

Hundreds of Clawdbot instances are publicly exposed.

With ZERO authentication.

Granting attackers FULL ROOT ACCESS.

Not theory. Real attacks are happening NOW:
→ Credential theft
→ Email inboxes wiped via prompt injection
→ Complete system takeover

Let's break down what nobody's telling you:

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗖𝗹𝗮𝘄𝗱𝗯𝗼𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗱𝗼:
• Execute shell commands
• Read/write/delete ANY file
• Control your browser
• Access all your messaging apps
• Store your secrets in PLAINTEXT

Now imagine an attacker with that access.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝟲 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗸𝘀:

1️⃣ Exposed Admin Ports
   → No auth = Full shell access

2️⃣ Plaintext Secrets
   → API keys, SSH keys, AWS creds in plain JSON

3️⃣ Prompt Injection
   → Malicious emails can wipe your inbox

4️⃣ Supply Chain Attacks
   → ClawdHub skills can be backdoored

5️⃣ Fake VS Code Extension
   → "ClawdBot Agent" drops ScreenConnect malware

6️⃣ Root Access Required
   → Compromise = Total control

Still want to install it on your main machine?

Here's how to use it SAFELY:

✅ NEVER expose to public internet
✅ Run on isolated/disposable VM only
✅ Enable strong auth (token-based)
✅ Don't run as root
✅ VPN/Tailscale for access only
✅ Encrypt secrets at rest
✅ Audit with `moltbot security audit`

The cool factor doesn't excuse the security gaps.

Your JARVIS shouldn't be giving keys to every hacker on Shodan.

## 💬 SECOND COMMENT (Optional - engagement driver)

```
Honest questions for the security community:

1. Would you install an AI assistant that requires root access?

2. Do you vet GitHub projects with 30K+ stars any differently than smaller ones?

3. How do you balance "cool new tool" vs "attack surface expansion"?
