A deepfake of your CEO costs less than a pizza. 🍕

No, really. $20.

In January 2026, I analyzed the explosion of "Deepfake-as-a-Service" (DaaS) platforms.

Here's what I found:

📊 The market:
→ Criminal platforms offer voice cloning for $5-15
→ Full video deepfakes start at $20
→ Enterprise packages at $200-500
→ Real-time video manipulation available

🇮🇳 Real case: Narayana Murthy deepfake
→ Scammers created a convincing video of the Infosys founder
→ Promoted fake "government investment scheme"
→ Victims lost ₹43 lakh (~$51,000)
→ The video looked legitimate to most viewers

⚠️ What's changed:
→ 3-second voice samples now sufficient for cloning
→ Consumer GPUs can run deepfake models
→ Mobile apps enable real-time face swapping
→ "Jailbroken" AI models bypass safety restrictions

🛡️ How organizations are fighting back:
→ UK launches AI Security Institute detection challenge
→ India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act addresses AI fraud
→ Verification code words for high-value calls
→ Multi-channel confirmation requirements

The uncomfortable truth:

Your voice is already on LinkedIn (videos, podcasts).
Your face is everywhere (photos, meetings).
You've given attackers everything they need.

What's YOUR organization doing to verify executive communications?
