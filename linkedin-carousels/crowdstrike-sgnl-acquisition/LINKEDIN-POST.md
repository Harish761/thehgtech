## 📝 MAIN POST (Copy this)

```
CrowdStrike just paid $740 MILLION for a company you've probably never heard of.

Here's why it's a game-changer for identity security:

The problem:
→ 80% of breaches involve compromised credentials
→ AI agents now outnumber human users 45:1
→ Traditional IAM grants access once and "hopes for the best"

Enter SGNL:
✓ Zero standing privileges
✓ Continuous access evaluation (CAEP protocol)
✓ Real-time risk-based access decisions
✓ Just-in-time, just-enough permissions

This isn't just another acquisition.

It's CrowdStrike positioning for a world where:
• AI agents need security guardrails
• Non-human identities are exploding
• Identity IS the new perimeter

What this means for security teams:
1. Audit your non-human identities (there are probably 45x more than you think)
2. Map your standing privileges
3. Start planning for zero standing privilege architectures

The future of identity security isn't "grant access" — it's "evaluate every request."

CrowdStrike gets it. Do you?

3. React to reshares with thoughtful comments

### Suggested Tags (in separate comment, not main post)

## 🎯 EXPECTED PERFORMANCE

Based on acquisition/industry analysis content:
- **Impressions**: 10,000-30,000 (news-driven content performs well)
- **Click-through**: 3-5% to the full article
- **Engagement**: High if timed well (first few days after announcement)
- **Reshares**: Industry news typically gets more reshares than educational content

## 💡 CONTENT ANGLE

This carousel takes a **"what it means for you"** angle rather than just reporting the news:

✅ Not just: "CrowdStrike bought SGNL"
✅ But: "Here's why this changes identity security forever and what you should do about it"

The cartoon presenter style makes technical M&A content more accessible and memorable.
