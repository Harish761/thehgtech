## 📅 POSTING STRATEGY

### Best Time
- **Tuesday 8-10 AM** or **Wednesday morning**
- Patch Tuesday content peaks mid-week
- IT teams discuss during Tuesday/Wednesday

### Text vs. Carousel?
For Patch Tuesday: **CAROUSEL WINS**
- Technical content benefits from visual breakdown
- Slideable content = higher dwell time
- Lists and checklists are highly saveable
- More slides = more swipes = better algorithm signal

### Engagement Strategy
1. Post carousel with caption
2. IMMEDIATELY add first comment with link
3. Reply to every comment within first hour
4. Ask "What's your patching timeline?" to drive comments
5. Reshare to Twitter/X with thread
