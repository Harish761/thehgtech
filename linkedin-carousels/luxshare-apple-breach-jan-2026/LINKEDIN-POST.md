```
Apple's Vision Pro secrets may have been stolen.

RansomHub just claimed they breached Luxshare—Apple's EXCLUSIVE Vision Pro manufacturer.

Here's what we know ⬇️

The scope is massive:
→ 1TB+ of confidential data allegedly stolen
→ 3D CAD designs for Vision Pro, iPhone, AirPods
→ 6 years of engineering files (2019-2025)
→ Potentially includes UNRELEASED 2026 products
→ Employee personal data also taken

Why this matters:

Luxshare isn't just any supplier:
• EXCLUSIVE manufacturer of Vision Pro
• Growing iPhone assembly share
• AirPods and Apple Watch production
• $15B+ annual revenue from Apple

One breach = Apple's entire product roadmap at risk.

Other companies allegedly affected:
• NVIDIA
• LG
• Tesla

What security teams should learn:

1️⃣ Third-party risk IS your risk
2️⃣ Exclusive partners = concentrated risk
3️⃣ Audit your Tier 1 suppliers regularly
4️⃣ Segment sensitive data across partners
5️⃣ Monitor dark web for early warnings

⚠️ Important: Apple and Luxshare have NOT confirmed this breach.

But the lesson remains:
Your security is only as strong as your weakest supplier.
